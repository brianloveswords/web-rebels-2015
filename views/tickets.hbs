  <a name="sponsor"><h2>Can I purchase extra tickets as a sponsor?</h2></a>
  <p>No, we do not sell tickets outside of regular ticket sales and the tickets which come included with sponsor packages.
      Demand for tickets far exceeds the available number of tickets, and we very strongly believe, as a community conference, in giving everyone an equal chance to purchase them.</p>
