    <p>
      Web Rebels is a conference organised by and for the community,
      and it's important to us that all members of the community
      should be included, even those who would normally be unable to
      attend for financial reasons. We're very happy to be able to
      offer the Web Rebels Scholarship Programme to offer financial
      aid to people from underrepresented groups wanting to attend the
      conference.

    <a name="eligibility"></a>
    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      Scholarships are primarily intended to assist people from groups
      traditionally underrepresented in the local developer community,
      including women, people of non-Scandinavian descent and people
      with disabilities. However, we wouldn't presume to be able to
      provide a complete list of underrepresented groups, so all
      applications will be considered. Eligibility ultimately depends
      on the discretion of the selection committee.
    </p>

    <h2>Selection</h2>
    <p>
      All applications will be reviewed by the selection committee,
      and will be accepted at their discretion, although selection
      will primarily favour diversity concerns and financial need. All
      information provided to the committee will be kept strictly
      confidential.
    </p>

    <h2>Award</h2>
    <p>
      Selected applicants will receive a fully paid ticket for the
      conference, and may also apply for travel and lodging
      assistance, although our ability to offer this will be more
      limited.
