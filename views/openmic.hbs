<h2>Wednesday 20th May</h2>
<p>The evening before the conference, we will be hanging out at <a href="http://vbarogbistro.no/">V Bar</a>, right next door to the <a href="./location">venue</a>. Open Mic is the conference pre-party and everyone welcome!</p>

<h2>Warm up with lightning talks</h2>
<p>We want to create a friendly environment where attendees can have a go at speaking. There will be batches of 10 minute lightning talks in an informal setting for a smaller audience. Slides are completely optional! And live coding only if your really want to.</p>


<h2>First time speakers very welcome</h2>
<p>If you have never delivered a talk before, remember that there is a first time for everything. There was a first time you touched a keyboard, and a first time you wrote "hello world". This is the perfect opportunity grab the mic for the first time and share some thoughts.</p>
